      My name is <b>Dev Jigishkumar Shah</b> and currently I am studying Advanced Diploma in
      Computer Programming offered by Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology. This research
      was a part of my project for the course Web Programming Principles (WEB 222).

      Apart from this I have also made my web resume using HTML and CSS which you could visit by
      clicking <a href="https://busycaesar.github.io/">HERE</a>. Moreover, I also like to create
      content and upload it on my YouTube channel and Instagram which you can access from my resume.
